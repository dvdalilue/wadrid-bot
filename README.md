Welcome to Wadrid!

This is a first approach to Telegram bots using Bernard as development framework.

The bot has one feature, choose one frame of a rocket launch video, being this frame the exact moment when the rocket launched. Initially, it presents one "random" frame to the user, receiving as input basically *yes* or *no* (indicating if the rocket has launched yet or not), bisects the entire video, choose a new frame, and repeats until the partition is reduced to one element.

If you require help to continue, please refer to
[BERNARD's documentation](https://github.com/BernardFW/bernard).
