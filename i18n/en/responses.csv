ERROR,Woops. Something went wrong.
HELP, I don't understand what you're saying but I know these special words that might help you:
START_CMD, /reset - start from zero
SEARCH_CMD, /search - begin or continue the image search
WELCOME, Hi {name}! Wanna help me with something?
WELCOME, {name}! I'm on a mission and your assistence is required. Care to join me?
LOOP, I'll repeat this message until you say 'yes'. My intelligence has problems processing the word 'no'. So will you help me or not?
BEGIN, I need your visual experience to understand some images and solve an ambiguous task. Tell me if the rocket has either launched or not in the image frames of a video. Are you ready? (use the link if the preview is not big enough)
CONTINUE, It seems you have done some investigation already. Want to continue?
IMAGE, What do you see on the image?
FRAME, did the rocket launch yet? (Yes/No)
FINAL, You've found it. The rocket take-off at {frame}!. You can /start all over again or do you want me to take you directly to another /search?
